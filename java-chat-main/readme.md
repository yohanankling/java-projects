# Chat Project

Welcome to the Chat Project! This project allows you to run a chat server from the command-line interface (cmd), add multiple clients, and engage in real-time conversations. It operates over TCP and supports both broadcast and private messaging functionalities. While this version does not include a graphical user interface (GUI), you can find an alternative version with GUI in the pythonprojects repository. Moreover, i have developed an advanced Android version that takes the chatting experience to a whole new level!

## How to Use

1. **Run the Server**: To get started, run the server script from your command prompt by executing the appropriate command.

2. **Add Clients**: Once the server is up and running, you can connect multiple clients to it. Use the client script to join the chat room and start chatting.

3. **Broadcast Messages**: To send a message to all connected users, simply type "/broadcast" followed by your message.

4. **Private Messaging**: For private messages, type the username of the recipient followed by the message you want to send. For instance, to send a private message to the user "yohanan," type: "yohanan hi!"

## Project Variants

1. **PythonProjects Repository**: In the pythonprojects repository, you can find another version of this chat project with a graphical user interface (GUI). It offers a more visually appealing and interactive chat experience.

2. **Android App**: I have also developed an Android app for this chat project, which provides an even more feature-rich and convenient way to chat with others. The Android app version takes advantage of the capabilities of mobile devices, enhancing your chatting experience.
